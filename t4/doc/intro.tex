\section{Introduction}
The purpose of this work is to reproduce an audio amplifier circuit, using a theoretical analysis and a simulation. The circuit consisted of a gain stage circuit and an output stage, a source $V_s$ of maximum voltage 10mV, a load of 8$\Omega$ and a supply voltage Vcc of 12V. Both stages used transistors, but while the gain space used a NPN transistor, the output stage used a PNP model.\\
The voltage source is connected to the gain stage which in turn is connected in series to the output stage, which is also connected to Vcc.\\
For the simulation, we used the circuit that can be seen in Figure \ref{fig:circngspice}

In theoretical analysis, to simulate the transistors, we used three resistors and one voltage controlled current source. The circuit used can be seen in Figure \ref{fig:circoc}

The comparison between the two methods can be seen in Section ~\ref{sec:res}.
The values of each component used are $R_s=100\Omega$, $C_1=1.7 mF$, $R_{B_1}=80k\Omega$, $R_{B_2}=20k\Omega$, $R_C=1k\Omega$, $R_{E_1}=100\Omega$, $C_E=1.7 mF$, $R_{E_2}=100\Omega$, $C_{2}=1.7mF$.
