\section{Conclusions}
As we can see in Section ~\ref{sec: res}, the results between the simulation and the theoretical analysis differ slightly. This may be due to the fact that we used different models: the diodes were approximated by voltage sources or resistors in the second, while \textit{ngspice}'s default model was used in the simulation. The average is quite similar in both cases, but the ripple is quite different. The simulation uses more complex parameters which leads us to think it's more reliable than the simpler theoretical model. Our merit result is small, the cost being too great to offset the good ripple and average.
