\section{\textit{Octave} Results}
Putting both systems of equations in \textit{Octave}, we get the solutions for mesh currents in the first case, and node voltages in the second. From this and Ohm's law we get the following tables for resistors' voltages and currents. The last two lines of both tables pertain to the dependent sources, where $V_c$ refers to the current dependent voltage source and $I_b$ to the voltage dependent current source.
