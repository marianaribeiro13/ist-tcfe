\subsection{Frequency response}
A transfer function is a function that computes output from input. In the case of an RC circuit such as the one being studied here, the transfer function is simply the quotient of phasors, the phasor correspondent to the voltage of the capacitor ($v_c (t)$) and the phasor correspondent to the voltage source ($v_s (t)$):
\[ T(\omega)= \frac{\widetilde{v_c}}{\widetilde{v_s}}=\frac{1}{1+j\omega R C}\]
Since the transfer function is complex, we can represent its magnitude and phase as functions of $\omega$. 
\[ |T(\omega)|= \frac{1}{\sqrt{1+\omega^2 R^2 C^2}}\]
