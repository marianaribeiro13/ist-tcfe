\subsection{Natural Solution}
\label{ssec:n}
The natural solution only depends on initial charge (voltage) and on the time constant. The voltage source $V_s$ needs to be turned off to get the natural response of the system, so $V_s=0$ and  $V_{6n}(t)$ becomes
\begin{equation}
  V_{6n}(t) = Ae^{-\frac{t}{\tau}}
\end{equation}
With the results obtained in section ~\ref{ssec:R}, we get both $A=V_{6n}(0)=V_x$,and the time constant $\tau$. We will plot the results in the time interval [0, 20] ms. \\
