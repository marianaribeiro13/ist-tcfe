\subsection{Natural Solution}
\label{section:n}
The natural solution only depends on initial charge (voltage) and on the time constant. With the results obtained in section ~\ref{section:R}, we determined the natural solution $V_{6n}(t)$, in the interval [0, 20] ms. \\
In order to do that, we used equation (A DE BAIXO)
\begin{equation}
V_{6n}(t) = Ae^{-\frac{t}{\tau}}
\end{equation}
Where $V_{6n}(0) = A$, therefore, $A=V_x$ since we used the capacitor voltage $V_x$ for t<0 as the initial condition.\\
The results can be seen in section ~\ref{}.
