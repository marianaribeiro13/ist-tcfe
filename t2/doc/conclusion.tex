\section{Conclusion}
\label{sec:conclusion}
In this laboratory assignment, the objective of analysing the RC circuit has been achieved. \\
When looking at the tables of currents and voltages obtained by \textit{Octave} and \textit{ngspice} for the analysis of the circuit when t\textless 0 we can that they perfectly match, which is expected since all components considered are linear.\\
In the analysis for t=0, just one voltage is different than 0, $V_6$, and both methods resulted in the same value for this voltage, and for the current that goes throught $R_5$. In the \textit{ngspice} simulation the rest of voltages, that were supposed to be zero (and were, in the table obtained by \textit{Octave}), are in fact values of very small order of magnitude being practically negligible, which checks out.\\
In terms of all of the plots, the ones obtained by \textit{Octave} were a perfect match for the ones obtained in \textit{ngspice}.\\
Only the magnitude plot regarding $V_6$ had any differences, when comparing both tools, since they seem to be mirrored. Also, in the magnitude plot in \textit{ngspice} for $V_c$ the value for low frequencies should have been 0, but was slightly higher.
