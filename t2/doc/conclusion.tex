\section{Conclusion}
\label{sec:conclusion}

In this laboratory assignment the objective of analysing the circuit has been achieved. \\
The results obtained by \textit{octave} in both the nodal and mesh theoretical analysis matched each other. The simulation results matched the theoretical results. The reason for this perfect match is the fact that this is a straightforward circuit containing only linear components, so the theoretical and simulation models cannot differ. Of these three methods, nodal analysis was the most prone to error for its high number of equations (7) compared with mesh analysis (3). The simulation was simple and quite effective. With very few commands we got the same results as the lengthier theoretical analysis.
